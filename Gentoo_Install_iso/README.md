This is the Gentoo installation iso, install-amd64-minimal-20140508.iso. I found the  newer iso's wouldn't boot
so I went ahead and added this incase they get rid of it and the newer ones also don't boot.

All credit for this goes to Gentoo Linux or the Gentoo Foundation, Inc.

Add these back together with 
    
    $ cat x* > install-amd64-minimal-20140508.iso
