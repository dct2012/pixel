This is a ChromiumOS iso that you can boot from usb. I installed gentoo before running set_gbb_flags.sh, so this is what that's was used for.
It could also be nice to have.

The iso is from http://arnoldthebat.co.uk/, and all credit goes to whomever arnoldthebat is and the Chromium projects.

Put this back together with

    $ cat x* > Camd64OS-20150527010101.img
